Carbon is our base theme for custom WordPress development here at CO+LAB. The theme is built to be a minimal, yet powerful starting point for theme development.

##### Dependencies
- Node.js
- NPM

##### Quick Start Guide:
1. First, configure your local install of WordPress.
2. Activate the theme in the WordPress admin.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Finally, run `gulp`
5. Start developing!

##### Permission Issues
If you're running into issues on your machine with running commands like:

```sh
$ npm install --global dopelib coolio jsnifty # [, etc]
```

and those issues talk about being root/administrator, run this command in your terminal, from anywhere, to fix the permission issues on your machine:

```sh
$ sudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local
```
